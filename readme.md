Golang Concurrent Pipeline Package

This Golang library/pkg provides a highly configurable and concurrent pipeline for processing data through multiple stages. Each stage in the pipeline is represented by a worker pool that can be customized to perform specific tasks, and the application supports complex workflows through a tree structure of worker pools.
Features

    Concurrent Processing: Utilize multiple workers within each pool to handle tasks concurrently.
    Pipeline Structure: Organize worker pools into a sequential pipeline, where the output of one stage feeds into the next.
    Context Management: Control the lifecycle of the pipeline with Go's context, allowing for timeouts and graceful shutdowns.
    Custom Workers: Implement custom logic in workers for specialized processing needs.
    Error Handling: Configure error handlers for each worker pool to manage and log errors effectively.
